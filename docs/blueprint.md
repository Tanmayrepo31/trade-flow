- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif with a modern, objective, neutral look, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use consistent, modern icons from a set like Phosphor or Remix Icon to maintain a professional look. Favor outlined icons. Each icon should directly relate to the function it represents.
- Maintain a clean, grid-based layout with sufficient white space to improve readability and reduce visual clutter. Implement a responsive design to ensure compatibility across various devices.
- Subtle animations, such as smooth transitions and loading indicators, should be used to enhance the user experience without being distracting. All animations should be short, performant, and subtle to maintain focus and professionalism.
